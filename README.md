Patched with FMV Hardsub addendum by the Kotoba group (Slayerofgod, Leingod, Ayplyjuice)

Correction to that addendum by slayerofgod

This release undubs the remaining eleven voice clips and reverts the instructions for "Tales of the Dragon Buster"
minigame back to English

Thanks to Someone Special and the Kotoba Group
